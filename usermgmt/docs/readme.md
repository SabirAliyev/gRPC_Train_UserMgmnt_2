In the previous project versiion (1) we wrote a very simple unary gRPC service method. It this version we`re going to exsend the functionality of our gRPC UserManagement service. As you can imagine the UserManagement service might give you ability to create new users which functionality we already wrote. But it might also we provide functions to read existing data, updae user data end delete users. 
And in this version we will add new gRPC method called GetUsers(). When the client calls the GetUsers() service method, the gRPC service method will return the active list of users. So, any user when we were creating, using CreateNewUser() service method, shuld be retured in a list calling GetUsers() service method. By adding this method to our UserMemagement service we will lern ho we do the following. First we will lern how to write `Nested Proto Messages`. In secondly we will lern how to `Persist Data` between our gRPC service methods.
